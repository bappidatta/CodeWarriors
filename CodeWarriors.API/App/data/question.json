That url just needs a packages.json file at minimum, you could use satis or your own packagist if you want a more dynamic solution to the packages.json.</p><p>You can also just use git clone and then execute composer install yourself.<br/></p>",

The command will just copy the package into the current directory, than run composer install<br/><br/>You can use a private repository if you use authentification over ssh, for example:<br/></p><pre>{<br/>    &#34;require&#34;: {<br/>        &#34;vendor/my-private-repo&#34;: &#34;dev-master&#34;<br/>    },<br/>    &#34;repositories&#34;: [<br/>        {<br/>            &#34;type&#34;: &#34;vcs&#34;,<br/>            &#34;url&#34;:  &#34;git@bitbucket.org:vendor/my-private-repo.git&#34;<br/>        }<br/>    ]<br/>}<br/></pre><p><br/>See https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md<br/></p>",
